Carving cython programs info
Seam Carving (my algorithm - deletes path most like its neighbour each time)
Best version without masking: v3

ARGHH last night I made a lot of changes to v7(masking), today imported them into v4... and there's a bug. So back to using v3.
The right 1/4 or so of picture is shifted up, across the screen, comes up the bottom....
So it MUST be caused by something wrong with the vertical-shifting lines.. gee, I can't find what's wrong though. Soo....
Probably caused by the new looping, optionally doing width or vertical seams...

Wish I could break the long function up.. but #(*&$ ndarrays cant be used in .. uh... hmm.
They can't be global variables.

needs to be updated with v7 changes.

Best masking version: v7.
